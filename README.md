# Shopping List API

This repository contains a simple Express server application that provides a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for a shopping list. The server uses MySQL as the database backend and stores the shopping list items and their quantities.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- MySQL Database
- `.env` file with the required environment variables (explained below)

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Setup your MySQL database (in this case you can change *your_database_name* with your actual database name) and create a .env file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

```makefile
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
```

4. Run the server:
